# Check AppleCare Coverage
Copy a serial number, invoke the keyword in Alfred, and it will open the coverage check website with the serial number populated in the correct place.

# IP Info 
Using the keyword "ip" will throw all of your network info to large type on your screen.
This includes your local address, your default gateway, the DNS servers you are using, and your current DHCP server.
Use the keyword "dhcp" to just see the DHCP server address.

# Password Generator 
Use the keyword "pwd" followed by a number as an argument to generate a random password, and copy it to your clipboard.
The resulting password will actually be double the length of your argument. So, if you use "3" the resulting password will be 6 characters long.
